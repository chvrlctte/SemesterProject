            <p>Born into a family with a long line of car lovers, this project was destined to be created by Charlotte Marchildon.</p>
            <p>The hobby began at 15 years old when the first project car came to fruition, a black 1987 Honda CRX. After blood, sweat and tears made the car a beauty again, another car made it's way into the family. A 1985 Honda Prelude. That came and went. Then came a 1985 Toyota Corolla, the dream car Charlotte always wished for. But the dream didn't stop there. Next up, a 1992 Nissan 240sx. Another car that took years to acquire with a dream in mind. Then, at last, we come to a 2009 BMW 135i. The long line continues, and has inspired Charlotte to create a website that helps everyone else build their dream cars, too.</p>
